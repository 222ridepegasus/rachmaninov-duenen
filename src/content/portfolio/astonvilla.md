intro: |
  I was tasked with designing an improved version of Urban Zoo’s templated app package for Aston Villa. The goal was to move beyond the standard offering and deliver a tailored experience that reflected the club’s brand and needs. My work focused on expanding the template with additional UI components, consolidating the user experience, and ensuring the new elements meshed seamlessly with existing features.

    heading: "Home Screen / Dynamic Modules"
    body: |
     Working closely with the CEO of Urban Zoo and Aston Villa’s Head of Digital, our small team rebuilt the app’s UI system from the ground up. A key focus was the home screen, which introduced a new dynamic match card module. This allowed fans to swipe between past results, live matches, upcoming fixtures, and the current league table, all from a single entry point.
     
     Additional modules were designed to appear conditionally, such as breaking news alerts, a “listen live” panel, a refreshed mini news carousel, and updated treatments for video and social media content within the main feed. Together these changes made the home screen more flexible, responsive, and engaging for supporters.

    heading: "Squad Profile"
    body: |
      As part of the overhaul I reworked and custom-styled the squad profile to feel more dynamic and tailored to Aston Villa. Players were presented as easily browsable cards, which opened into an overlay for deeper information. From there, supporters could swipe through additional cards showing a player’s biography, related news articles, and a performance radar. This approach made the squad section both more engaging and more functional, giving fans quick access to detail without breaking their browsing flow.

    heading: "Match Centre"
    body: |
      The Match Centre was redesigned to feel more immersive and useful for fans. Before kick-off it featured a branded countdown to the match, while during play it switched to a multi-tabbed layout where supporters could swipe between live updates, line-ups, match stats and more. For premium users the experience was expanded with deeper integration into Villa TV, giving access to exclusive video content and post-match coverage directly within the app.
