intro: |
  In September 2017 I joined Solid Clouds in Reykjavík as the dedicated UX/UI Designer for **Starborne: Sovereign Space**, a interface heavy large-scale PC strategy game. My role was to establish the game’s UI framework and guide its evolution through the transition from Alpha to Beta.

  My work included creating wireframes and prototypes, building reusable UI components, and developing a colour palette and design system to ensure consistency across the game. I also produced the complete set of in-game icons, along with supporting logos and graphic illustrations.
